Ensure that you clearly indicate which question each of your responses are associated with. 3.2 Part A. Syllabus Read the course syllabus (posted on blackboard). For this question (on the document that you turn in), confirm that you have read the syllabus. Read the academic honesty policy for the GVSU School of Computing: https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm. For this question (on the document that you turn in), confirm that you have read and agree to abide by the academic honesty policy. 3.3 Part B. About me There are no right or wrong answers here. For full credit, respond with complete sentences (2 - 3 is probably all you need). Why are you taking this class and what do you hope to get out of the class? Think about your major and/or career goals. What kinds of data would it be useful to be comfortable analyzing? What kinds of insights would you want to gain from the data? 3.4 Part C. Group survey For all homework assignments after the first two, you will have the option to work with a partner. I strongly recommend that you work with a partner. However, if you would still prefer to work alone for the semester, that is fine. Do not worry if you don’t know anyone else in the class, I will take care of group assignment. See the syllabus for group policy. Your responses to these questions will help me to assign partners. Would you like to work individually or with a partner? If you would like to be assigned a partner, is there anyone in the class that you would like to be in a group with? (the request should be mutual to guarantee that I match you) If you would like to be assigned a partner, is there anyone in the class that you would not like to be in a group with? If you would like to be assigned a partner, would you be okay with a third group member if there are an odd number of individuals who want to work with a partner? What grade do you expect to earn in this course? Do you have any prior programming experience? If so, what programming languages do you have prior experience with? What data analysis software (if any) do you have experience with? What do you consider to be your strengths? E.g., coding, writing, searching/reading reference material, organization, etc. Are you able to bring a computer to class to work on in-class activities using data analysis software? 3.5 Part D. Data For this part of your homework, identify a source of “big data” that you find interesting. What source of big data did you choose and why? Imagine you have a dataset from the source you identified. What do the objects in your dataset represent? Describe at two attributes that each object in the dataset would have.

Ensure that you clearly indicate which question each of your responses are associated with. 5.2 Part A. Install R and RStudio 5.2.1 1. Install R For this course, you’ll need access to a computer with R installed. To install R, navigate to https://cran.r-project.org/, select the appropriate operating system, and follow the instructions to download and install the most recent version of R (should be version 4.2 or higher). If you’re having trouble, try reading the installation guide here: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html If you’re still having trouble getting R installed on your machine, talk to me during office hours or send me an email! For credit on this question, take a screenshot of you running R on your computer (either in a terminal or by running the “R” application, which brings up an R console). 5.2.2 2. Install RStudio RStudio is a free, feature-rich IDE for writing R code. I am not going to require that you to use RStudio for the rest of this class, but I strongly recommend that you do use RStudio if you are new to programming in R. You can download and install RStudio (the free version) here: https://posit.co/downloads/ For credit on this question, take a screenshot of you running RStudio on your computer. 5.2.3 3. Installing packages Throughout the semester you will need to be able to install R packages that are not pre-loaded into your R installation. For example, we’ll use the tidyverse collection of packages for many common data wrangling tasks. The tidyverse packages do not come with the default installation of R, so we will need to install them. To install the complete tidyverse collection of packages, you can run the following command in your R console in RStudio. install.packages(&quot;tidyverse&quot;) Alternatively, you can install packages through the RStudio menus: Tools &gt; Install Packages. You would type tidyverse in the Packages textbox and click install. For credit on this question, take a screenshot of you running (it must be clear that you successfully installed the package): library(tidyverse) If you have trouble, come talk to me after class / during office hours! 5.3 Part B. Read Chapter 2 of “Hands-On Programming with R”: https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/basics.html This chapter introduces much of what we have covered in class (though there are a few things you may not have seen yet). As you read, follow along in RStudio. 5.3.1 4. R basics By the end of the chapter, you should be able to write a function that rolls a six-sided die and returns the result. Modify the function that rolls a six-sided die to instead roll a 20-sided die. Include a screenshot of your code and a screenshot of you running your function.
